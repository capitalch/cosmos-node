}

//notes
1. Weights are used to display secured pages at client side
2. api end points can be designated for CRUD.

// Logic
User types and their functions
superAdmin: 
1. Create users of type buAdmin (busines unit admin)
2. Activates / deactivates BU's and applications
3. Associates / Deassociates buAdmin with a business unit or application
4. Super admin users cannot do any business transactions in any business unit or application
5. There can be multiple super admin users
6. Super admin users can be activated / deactivated
7. One SuperAdmin user can create another superAdmin user from client side. The first superAdmin user is created from a console application.
8. Create new business unit, Application. Associate / deassociate business unit with one or many apps.
    Each business unit has an array of appIds it is associated with.

buAdmin:
1. Create users of type buUser (business unit user)
2. Activates / deactivates buUser
3. Associates / deassociates buUser with business unit or application
5. Carries on business transactions

buUser:
1. Carries on business transactions on applications

CreateSuperAdmin console application
1. Inputs superAdmin user name, email, activate / deactivate, key as parameters. Default is activate.
2. Generates random password --> inserts username, email, random password, jRule:{userType:'superAdmin'} in database. Emails the user the random password with arequest to do change password.
    The user can do change password from 'change password' link in login screen. 
3. The first super admin user is created by this console application. Thereafter further super admin users can be created by existing super admin.

Login application
a) Provides normal login, create user, activate / deactivate user, change password. This is created as a module and can be embedded in any other Angular app.
b) Provides a service which contains the token and user information in rules array. There may be one interceptor service which may push token with every
    http request in header x-access-token.
c) Change password link --> Accepts userName / email, old password, new password. At server /change endpoint password is changed in database
    and use is sent a success mail.
d) Create new business unit, new application and do association between them
e) After login submit --> authenticate at server side and get token at client with userType + rules array
    1. userType is superAdmin
        a) The login screen disappears on successful login
        b) Following links are available:
            1) Create new super admin user'
            2) Activate / Deactivate existing super admin user
            3) Activate / Deactivate business unit
            4) Activate / Deactivate application
            5) Create new buAdmin user
            6) Activate / Deactivate existing buAdmin user
        c) The above links do work as per their names.
    2. userType is buAdmin
        a) Client has information of business units and applications the buAdmin is associated with from the rules array.
        b) Login screen disappears
        c) 'Create new user' link appears. The corresponding page has check box as isBuAdmin
        d) New user can be created after associating one or many business units and applications
        e) Submit will generate new user at server side by using /register link and post data
    3. Create new user functionality
        a) Rules array, new userName, email, userType is provided from client. 
        b) At server after verifying the token and userType random password is generated.
        c) New user is inserted in database and random password is sent to user with a request to change the password. 
            The user can change password from login screen.

//works
1. Login app. Change its name as ControlPanel
    a) Normal login
    b) Service to hold token at successful login
    c) Interceptor to inject token with every htp request
    d) Change password
    e) Create new super admin user / buAdmin / buUser
    f) Activate / deactivae super admin / buAdmin / buUser
    g) Can consider to create without routing
    h) Integrate ControlPanel application with another Angular application
2. server
    a) Create change password endpoint and its functionality
    b) Create console app to create first super admin user
    c) Activate / deactivate user, bu, application
    d) Register superAdmin, buAdmin, buUser with corresponding rules
    e) Each app end point is reached after authentication. At app end point the rules array is checked whether there is a matching 
        entry for the business unit and corresponding application. If entry is not found then authorization error is sent back to client.
3. Research
    a) Dynamic forms. Includes completion of dynamic forms.
    b) Interceptor and login as module
